        "description3": "The event takes place on the last Wednesday of every two months, where, through a session, three speakers present on any topic in development. We usually aim to balance the talks across three different levels: Novices, Proficient, and Advanced. This is to continue attracting not only students or beginners but also to draw attendees with experience and have a more enriched community.",

        "quote": "‚ÄúSince ancient times, society has functioned as a social species. We've had the ability to organize ourselves into groups based on our goals and interests. So, a community isn't something new, but it is something we should consider today for a growth with greater potential.‚Äù",
        "whoIs": "What and who are Web Dev Talks?",
        "description": "Web Dev Talks, also known as WDT, is a Colima-based community primarily focused on web development that does not belong to any company. We are the first community of software developers in the state and also the most diverse, with 10 years of experience supporting us.",
        "description2": "It has been formed throughout its history by people from different companies to remain neutral in the decisions made internally.",
        "motivationHeader": "Our motivation",
        "motivationBody1": "WDT was born from a romantic idea of several programmers who dreamed of having a neutral space for networking at least once a month and learning something new from people who were not necessarily their coworkers. Different areas and companies with different fields exist; sometimes, a different approach or technology can help us solve challenges in our daily work. We might even find the right person to help us with these challenges, which sometimes can lead to long-term work relationships.",
        "motivationBody2": "Part of the motivation for the community was also to reduce certain shortcomings of spaces to share and learn from people already working in the software industry. Before our community existed, it was challenging to find more people from the same niche gathered in a place other than people from the same office. So, for students in Colima without known graduates from software development areas, it was even more challenging to know what the future held for them, what the current job opportunities were, or the areas they should focus on to meet the needs of local companies and have more growth opportunities.",
        "dynamic": "Dynamics",
        "dynamicBody1": "One of the attendees' favorite dynamics is to change venues every two months. This allows them to learn about what each company offers, between the work environment and workstations. Basically, each session works for some people as a kind of more informal industrial visit without the need for paperwork to get to know local companies.",
        "socialImpact": "Social Benefit",
        "socialImpactBody1": "Supporting WDT is socially supporting positive impact on the new generations of professionals who benefit most from these types of events and having a strong local presence, which can make your company an aspirational goal for many people.",
        "jobsOffer": "Job Offer",
        "jobsOfferBody1": "Companies and attendees benefit from job offers, either by learning about their vacancies through slides or during networking while interacting with employees from their company (this second method being the most effective). Many of the people who have been part of our community as attendees have met their future and current employers in one of our sessions.",
        "sponsorBody": "All money and support raised from sponsorships are invested in improving the bimonthly events and the quality of the presented content. No member of the staff benefits economically from the support; all tasks performed by the team are carried out on a non-profit basis. All income is invested entirely for the benefit of the community.",

        "benefitsNote": "Over time, we have noticed that the benefits from sponsorship are even more effective when individuals (employees) from the companies also get involved as part of WDT, as their message reaches more organically.",
